# Data Preparation

The data preparation stage is crucial:
- These steps ensure that the dataset is clean and ready for further analysis and modeling by removing missing values, duplicates, and unnecessary columns.

## Step 1. **Check for NaN values**:
   ```python
   nan_counts = spotify_track_dataset.isnull().sum()
   print("\nNaN counts per column:")
   nan_counts
   ```
   This step checks for missing values (NaNs) in each column of the dataset and counts them. 

## Step 2. **Display rows with NaN values**:
   ```python
   nan_rows = spotify_track_dataset[spotify_track_dataset.isnull().any(axis=1)]
   print("Rows with NaN values:")
   nan_rows
   ```
   This step identifies and displays the rows that contain any NaN values.

## Step 3. **Drop rows with NaN values**:
   ```python
   spotify_track_dataset.dropna(inplace=True)
   ```
   This step removes all rows that contain NaN values from the dataset.

## Step 4. **Check for duplicates**:
   ```python
   spotify_track_dataset.duplicated().sum()
   ```
   This step checks for duplicate rows in the dataset and counts them.

## Step 5. **Drop unnecessary columns**:
   ```python
   spotify_track_dataset = spotify_track_dataset.drop(columns=["number"])
   ```
   This step removes columns that are not needed for the analysis, in this case, the "number" column.


## Content-based Filtering

In Content-based Filtering, there are three main steps to prepare the data before implementing it with the model.

The data preparation stage is crucial because:
- These columns collectively provide essential information for building a content-based recommendation system.
- It transforms raw data into a structured format that is suitable for analysis and machine learning models.
- Creating the TF-IDF matrix quantifies the text data, enabling numerical computations and similarity calculations.
- Calculating cosine similarity helps in identifying the closeness between different tracks, which is the basis for making recommendations in content-based filtering.

### Step 1: Prepare Content-based Data

```python
def data_preparation(self):
    self.content_based_data = pd.DataFrame({
        "track_id": self.dataset["track_id"].tolist(),
        "track_name": self.dataset["track_name"].tolist(),
        "album_name": self.dataset["album_name"].tolist(),
        "track_genre": self.dataset["track_genre"].tolist()
    })
    print("Content Based Data:")
    return self.content_based_data.head()
```

This step converts the dataset into a DataFrame with the relevant columns: `track_id`, `track_name`, `album_name`, and `track_genre`. The following output shown bellow:

| track_id          | track_name                     | album_name                                      | track_genre |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 5SuOikwiRyPMVoIQDJUgSV | Comedy                         | Comedy                                           | acoustic    |
| 4qPNDBW1i3p13qLCt0Ki3A | Ghost - Acoustic               | Ghost (Acoustic)                                 | acoustic    |
| 1iJBSr7s7jYXzM8EGcbK5b | To Begin Again                 | To Begin Again                                   | acoustic    |
| 6lfxq3CG4xtTiEg7opyCyx | Can't Help Falling In Love     | Crazy Rich Asians (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) | acoustic    |
| 5vjLSffimiIP26QG5WcN2K | Hold On                        | Hold On                                          | acoustic    |

### Step 2: Create TF-IDF Matrix

```python
def create_tfidf_matrix(self):
    self.tf = TfidfVectorizer()
    self.tfidf_matrix = self.tf.fit_transform(self.content_based_data["track_genre"])
    print("TF-IDF Matrix Shape:")
    return self.tfidf_matrix.shape
```

This step creates a TF-IDF matrix from the `track_genre` column to represent the text data in a numerical format. The output for TF-IDF Matrix Shape is `(113999, 114)`, with 113,999 rows (tracks) and 114 columns (unique genres).

### Step 3: Calculate Cosine Similarity

```python
def calculate_cosine_similarity(self):
    cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(self.tfidf_matrix)
    self.cosine_sim_df = pd.DataFrame(cosine_sim, index=self.content_based_data["track_name"], columns=self.content_based_data["track_name"])
    print("Cosine Similarity DataFrame:")
    return self.cosine_sim_df.head()
```

This step calculates the cosine similarity between tracks based on the TF-IDF matrix and stores the results in a DataFrame.

Cosine Similarity DataFrame:

## Collaborative Filtering

In Collaborative Filtering, there are three main steps to prepare the data before implementing it with the model.

The data preparation stage is crucial because:
- **Encoding categorical data**: Converts categorical variables into numerical formats that can be processed by machine learning algorithms.
- **Normalization**: Scales numerical features to a standard range, improving the performance and convergence of the model.
- **Shuffling**: Ensures that the data is randomly distributed, reducing biases and improving the generalization of the model.
- **Splitting data**: Separates the data into training and validation sets to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

### Step 1: Prepare Collaborative Filtering Data

For collaborative filtering, we will also focus on the song titles and their genres. Unlike content-based filtering, we will only extract three columns from the dataset:

- `track_id`
- `track_name`
- `popularity`

Since `track_id` and `track_name` are strings and unique, we will encode these two columns. The resulting dataframe will contain the encoded `track_id`, encoded `track_name`, and `popularity` columns.

### Step 2: Encode Data

a. **Encode categorical data**: Unique track IDs and track names are encoded into numerical values.
b. **Map encoded values**: The dataset columns `track_id` and `track_name` are mapped to their encoded values.
c. **Normalize the `popularity` column**: The popularity values are converted to a float type and then normalized to a range between 0 and 1.
d. **Shuffle the dataset**: The dataset is shuffled to ensure random distribution.

### Step 3: Split Data

```python
def get_splits(self, collaborative_based):
   x = collaborative_based[["track", "name"]].values
   y = collaborative_based["popularity"].values

   train_indices = int(0.8 * collaborative_based.shape[0])
   x_train, x_val, y_train, y_val = (
      torch.tensor(x[:train_indices], dtype=torch.long),
      torch.tensor(x[train_indices:], dtype=torch.long),
      torch.tensor(y[:train_indices], dtype=torch.float32),
      torch.tensor(y[train_indices:], dtype=torch.float32)
   )
   return x_train, x_val, y_train, y_val
```

- **Extract features and labels**: The features (`track` and `name`) and labels (`popularity`) are separated.
- **Split into training and validation sets**: 80% of the data is used for training and 20% for validation.

# Modeling and Result

## Content-Based Filtering

```text
ContentBasedModel(
  (fc1): Linear(in_features=114, out_features=128, bias=True)
  (fc2): Linear(in_features=128, out_features=64, bias=True)
  (fc3): Linear(in_features=64, out_features=1, bias=True)
)
```

First of all, a model named `ContentBasedModel` is created using PyTorch. This model initializes with an input dimension and contains three fully connected layers. The forward pass of the model applies ReLU activation to the first two layers and outputs the result from the final layer.

Next, a `ContentBasedRecommender` class is defined to handle dataset operations. Upon initialization, it takes a dataset and sets up placeholders for the model, TF-IDF matrix, and cosine similarity DataFrame. The `data_preparation` method organizes the dataset into a DataFrame, keeping track of important columns like track IDs, names, album names, and genres. In the `create_tfidf_matrix` method, a TF-IDF matrix is generated from the track genres using the `TfidfVectorizer`, providing a numerical representation of the textual data. The `calculate_cosine_similarity` method computes the cosine similarity between tracks based on the TF-IDF matrix, storing the results in a DataFrame for easy lookup. The `initialize_model` method sets the input dimension for the model based on the shape of the TF-IDF matrix and initializes the `ContentBasedModel`. The `train_model` method converts the TF-IDF matrix to a tensor and defines a dummy target variable. It uses mean squared error loss and Adam optimizer to train the model over a specified number of epochs, printing the loss every ten epochs.

Finally, the `get_recommendations` method retrieves the top `k` similar tracks to a given track name using the precomputed cosine similarity DataFrame and returns the recommendations. Here's example:

```python
recommendations = music_recommender.get_recommendations()
print("\nRecommendations:")
# Fire - Killer Hertz Remix
# 10
recommendations
```

Enter a track name: Fire - Killer Hertz Remix
Enter the number of recommendations you want: 10

Recommendations:
| track_name   | track_id                        | album_name                                 | track_genre       |

## Collaborative Filtering

First of all, we initialize the DataPreprocessor class to handle data encoding and normalization. This class maps unique track IDs and track names to numerical encodings and scales the popularity values.

Next, we define the RecommenderNet class, a neural network model with embedding layers for both tracks and track names, which helps capture latent features. The forward method computes the dot product of these embeddings and adds biases, applying a sigmoid activation function to produce the final output. We then set up the Trainer class to handle the training of the model. This class manages the training loop, calculating the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for both training and validation datasets, and prints the RMSE every ten epochs. The plot_rmse function is used to visualize the training and validation RMSE over epochs, helping to monitor the model’s performance and evaluate.

Finally, the RecommenderSystem class is responsible for generating track recommendations. It takes a track name, encodes it, and computes the predicted popularity for all tracks, returning the top recommendations based on these predictions. Utility functions like get_data_loaders assist in creating data loaders for training and validation. Here's example:

Recommendations based on track name: 'Fire - Killer Hertz Remix'

# Evaluation

## Content-Based Filtering

The evaluation metrics used in this project include Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss[3]. MSE is calculated as the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values[4]. The formula for MSE is[5]:

$$ \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 $$

where $y_i$ is the actual value, $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted value, and $n$ is the number of samples. MSE measures the average of the squares of the errors, which means it penalizes larger errors more than smaller ones, making it a useful metric for regression problems.

```text
Epoch [10/100], MSE Loss: 0.8078
Epoch [20/100], MSE Loss: 0.5818
Epoch [30/100], MSE Loss: 0.2868
Epoch [40/100], MSE Loss: 0.0303
Epoch [50/100], MSE Loss: 0.0305
Epoch [60/100], MSE Loss: 0.0045
Epoch [70/100], MSE Loss: 0.0043
Epoch [80/100], MSE Loss: 0.0016
Epoch [90/100], MSE Loss: 0.0015
Epoch [100/100], MSE Loss: 0.0012
```

Based on the evaluation metrics, the project outcomes can be described by the progression of the MSE loss over the training epochs. As the epochs progress, a decrease in MSE loss indicates that the model is learning and improving its predictions. Lower MSE values at the end of the training process suggest that the model has successfully minimized the error between its predictions and the actual values, leading to more accurate recommendations. This reflects positively on the model's performance and its ability to generate relevant track recommendations based on the content-based approach.

## Collaborative Filtering

The evaluation metric used in this project is Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). RMSE is calculated as the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values. The formula for RMSE is[6]:

$$RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n{(y_i - \hat{y_i})}^2}{N}}$$

where $y_i$ is the actual value, $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted value, and $n$ is the number of samples. RMSE measures the spread of errors and is useful for evaluating the accuracy of a model's predictions.

![Evaluation of RMSE](images/evaluate_rmse.png)

Project outcomes based on the evaluation metrics can be described by observing the RMSE values during training and validation. A lower RMSE value indicates better model performance, as it signifies smaller errors in predictions. RMSE values are calculated for each epoch during both the training and validation phases, allowing for the monitoring of the model's performance and adjustments as needed to improve accuracy.

These values indicate a slight improvement in the model's performance over time, with both training and validation RMSE decreasing.
